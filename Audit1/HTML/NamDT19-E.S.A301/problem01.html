      <h2>Basic HTML Animals</h2>
      <p>This is the first paragraph in our page. It introduces our animals</p>

      <h2>The Llama</h2>
      <p>
        Our Llama is a big fan of list items. When she spies a patch of them on
        a web page, she will eat them like sweets, licking her lips as she goes.
      </p>

      <h2>The Anaconda</h2>
      <p>
        The crafty anaconda likes to slither around the page, travelling rapidly
        by way of anchors to sneak up on his prey.
